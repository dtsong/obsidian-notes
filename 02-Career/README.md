# GenAI + Developer Productivity: Career Growth Plan

## Overview

This repository contains structured learning materials for positioning as a **GenAI Engineer with a focus on developer workflows and productivity**. The content is organized into five pillars that build on each other.

---

## The Pillars

| # | Pillar | Focus | Time Investment |
|---|--------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | [GenAI Engineering Fundamentals](./01-genai-engineering-fundamentals.md) | Prompting, models, evaluation, production | Month 1-2 |
| 2 | [Developer Productivity Measurement](./02-developer-productivity-measurement.md) | DORA, SPACE, DX, proving impact | Month 1-3 |
| 3 | [Agentic Systems & Tooling](./03-agentic-systems-tooling.md) | Agents, orchestration, human-in-the-loop | Month 2-4 |
| 4 | [Developer Tooling Landscape](./04-developer-tooling-landscape.md) | Cursor, Copilot, code review, internal tools | Ongoing |
| 5 | [Staying Current](./05-staying-current.md) | Learning system, sources, community | Ongoing |

---

## Quick Start

1. **Read Pillar 1 & 2 in parallel** — Fundamentals + Measurement are foundational
2. **Start a small project immediately** — Learning by doing > reading
3. **Set up your information diet** — Use Pillar 5 to build sustainable habits
4. **Deep-dive into Pillar 3 & 4** — As you encounter agents and tooling in practice

## 90-Day Plan

### Month 1: Foundations

**Learning:**
- [ ] Complete Pillar 1 (GenAI Fundamentals)
- [ ] Read DORA State of DevOps report
- [ ] Read "DevEx: What Actually Drives Productivity" paper

**Building:**
- [ ] Build a simple eval suite (20+ test cases) for a real use case
- [ ] Implement multi-provider abstraction layer

**System:**
- [ ] Set up RSS reader with Pillar 5 sources
- [ ] Create Twitter "AI" list

### Month 2: Depth

**Learning:**
- [ ] Complete Pillar 2 (Productivity Measurement)
- [ ] Deep-dive into one agentic framework (recommend Temporal or LangGraph)

**Building:**
- [ ] Build a developer survey + metrics correlation prototype
- [ ] Implement a single-agent + tools workflow

**System:**
- [ ] Start weekly learning log
- [ ] Identify one community to join

### Month 3: Integration

**Learning:**
- [ ] Complete Pillar 3 (Agentic Systems)
- [ ] Evaluate 2-3 AI dev tools systematically

**Building:**
- [ ] Extend an open-source tool (Continue.dev extension or Cursor rules)
- [ ] Build internal tool prototype or contribute to existing

**System:**
- [ ] Write one public piece (blog, thread, repo README)
- [ ] Conduct quarterly review

## Project Ideas (Prioritized)

### High Impact + Moderate Effort

| Project | Why | Skills Demonstrated |
|---------|-----|---------------------|
| DX Survey + Metrics Dashboard | Directly relevant to Shield AI role | Measurement, data analysis |
| Multi-Provider LLM SDK | Shows production thinking | Abstraction, reliability |
| Cursor Rules Library | Shareable, visible work | Tool knowledge, team enablement |

### Medium Impact + Lower Effort

| Project | Why | Skills Demonstrated |
|---------|-----|---------------------|
| Eval Suite for Specific Use Case | Foundational skill | Evaluation methodology |
| Tool Evaluation Report | Publishable content | Critical analysis |
| Learning Log / Blog | Builds in public | Communication, learning |

### Stretch Projects

| Project | Why | Skills Demonstrated |
|---------|-----|---------------------|
| Continue.dev Extension | Open source contribution | Deep tool knowledge |
| Agent with HITL Checkpoints | Defense-relevant | Safety, orchestration |
| Cost Optimization Dashboard | ROI narrative | Business impact |

## Key Metrics to Track

### Personal Development

- [ ] Hours spent on deliberate learning per week
- [ ] Projects completed per quarter
- [ ] Public artifacts produced (blogs, repos, talks)
- [ ] New concepts applied in work

### Technical Competency

- [ ] Can I explain prompt engineering techniques and when to use each?
- [ ] Can I design an eval suite for a new use case?
- [ ] Can I architect an agentic workflow with appropriate guardrails?
- [ ] Can I measure the impact of an AI tool intervention?

### Market Position

- [ ] Am I building visible work in my niche?
- [ ] Do I have a network of peers in this space?
- [ ] Can I speak credibly about GenAI + developer productivity?
